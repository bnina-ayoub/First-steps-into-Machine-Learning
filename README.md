1st Project (King County’s home dataset) :

Goal : Find the best model to predict a house’s price. 

Steps :

1. Explored the King County’s home dataset (data preprocessing and data visualization steps).

2. Split the data into a training set and a testing set. 

3. In order to predict house prices I :

    - Applied linear regression

    - Plotted the linear regression.  

    - Applied multiple-linear regression. 

    - Applied polynomial regression.

    - Measured the performance of each model.



2nd Project (Titanic passengers dataset) :

Goal : Predict if a passenger will survive or not. 

1. Explored the titanic-passengers dataset (data preprocessing and data visualization steps).

2. Split the data into a training set and a testing set. 

3. In order to predict if a passenger will survive or not I :

    - Applied logistic regression to predict house prices. 

    - Plotted the linear regression. 

    - Measured the performance of the model.
